**Procedure**

Play with tables.

**Things to check**

* Styles are applied correctly even in the mixed context (e.g. selection begins in a paragraph and ends in a table).
* Styles from table cells (background color) and headings (background color and color) are applied only to table cells or headings.
* The table is not splitted into two after applying styles.

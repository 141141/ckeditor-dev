Drag one of the borders separating the cells by the part in the first and last row.

**Expected**: Dragging by these parts is possible, the shadowy pillar created when dragging is the height of the table.

**Unexpected**: Dragging by these parts is not possible, the shadowy pillar is shorter than the height of the table.

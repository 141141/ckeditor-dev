1. Click on the "Attach panel" button.
2. Click on the "Set title" button.

Expected result:

A balloon panel should be created and positioned so that its triangular part points at "Test L".

The panel should move when the editor is scrolled so that it always points at "Test L".

The panel should stay (when it's possible) within the viewport and the editor area.

Clicking "Set title" should change the title to "The title has been set".
